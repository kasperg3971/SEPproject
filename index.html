                    <center>Computer programming is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification
                        of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one or more programming
                        languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects,
                        including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. Related tasks include testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code, implementation of the build system, and management of derived artifacts
                        such as machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding
                        reserved for the actual writing of source code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can
                        be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms. There are programmable
                        machines that use a limited set of specific instructions, rather than the general programming languages of modern computers. Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute
                        player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age.[1] From the early 1800s, programs were used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.[2]
                        However, their programs (such as a player piano's scrolls) could not produce different behavior in response to some input or condition. Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computer field,
                        and many more still are being created every year. Many programming languages require computation to be specified in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use other forms of program
                        specification such as the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it). The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning).
                        Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference.
                        Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C,
                        C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal. source:(wiki)
